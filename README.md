## POLITECNICO DI TORINO -  Masterâ€™s Degree in SOFTWARE ENGINEERING 
# Smart Contract Analysis and Visualization Software

This project contains my Software Engineer Master's Thesis project.

The result we wanted to obtain was to provide a tool that allows the user to read and modify the content of a Solidity smart contract.

All of it while being supported by an LLM and receiving vulnerability warnings.
