# Assuming you have a Go environment set up, get the ANTLR runtime for Go
go get github.com/antlr/antlr4/runtime/Go/antlr

# Now, the Go code is generated in the $GO_TARGET_DIR directory, and you can use it in your Go project.
# To use the generated parser, you might need to write a Go program that imports the generated package
# and uses it to parse Solidity files according to your project's requirements.

# Note: This script does not automatically compile or test the Go code against a Solidity file,
# as the usage of the generated parser in Go will depend on the specifics of your project.
